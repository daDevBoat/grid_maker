# grid_maker
## Description
A grid maker for grid based games.

## User instructions
Change the num_of_rows and num_of_cols variables to the desired number, and then run the program.

The default grid layout consists of all zeroes (0).
Press 0-9 to select what number should be placed in the grid.
0 is blank, which basically makes it an eraser.

Press enter or close the window when done drawing.
The grid will then be printed to the terminal.
